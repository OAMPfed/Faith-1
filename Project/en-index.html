                <p>As a front-end developer, you write the code behind what you see and interact with when you open a
                    website, a program or an app. There is an increasing need for developers who possess a combination
                    of technical and visual expertise. This two-year education programme provides you with the skills
                    for practical work within the main areas of developing interactive and dynamic products. The

                <h3>BEST PRACTICES FOR DEVELOPERS</h3>
                <p>In this programme you will learn best practices for developers. You will be able to produce
                    interactive online solutions, both visually and technically, and implement an interactive solution
                    from the conceptual stage until the final product. Students will build networks with graphic
                    designers, interaction designers, programmers and content developers. They will further be able to
                    collaborate with external specialist environments in the fields of social media, universal design,
                    search engine optimization and IT security.</p>

                <h3>LEARN CODING AND PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</h3>
                <p>The students will receive a thorough introduction to industry tools used for web development. You
                    will learn principles for good design, how webpages and interactive products are built both
                    logically and visually, and how website technologies communicate with back-end systems. You will
                    gain insights into programming languages such as Java, C-based languages, Ruby, php, and Python, all
                    of which have different strengths and weaknesses and different uses.</p>
                <p>JavaScript is a key tool for frontend developers. In combination with HTML and CSS, JavaScript is
                    essential to create dynamic and interactive online solutions. It is also important to consider when
                    to use JavaScript frameworks and when it is better to solve tasks without using it. You will be
                    introduced to the most updated JavaScript frameworks at any given time, such as Angular and React.
                    The field is developing rapidly, and new frameworks are continually being launched.</p>
                <p>Sass is the main CSS tool the students will learn, but the programme also covers tools like Less,
                    Stylus and the CSS framework Susy. Towards the end of the programme, the students will be introduced
                    to Ajax to develop more advanced online solutions.</p>

                <h3>PROGRAMME OBJECTIVES</h3>
                <p>The programme focuses on developing products in the intersection between the customer experience and
                    system development. The products we develop during the programme should have both a high aesthetic
                    value, good functionality and correct technical execution. This means the students will learn about
                    the design process, interaction design and programming. The main objective of the programme is to
                    gain practical skills, and the training programme is largely comprised of practical assignments
                    where you will be working with industry-specific tasks.</p>
                <p>Students will get insights into how to exercise entrepreneurship. A professional life as a frontend
                    developer requires expertise in workflows, automation and streamlining og both working processes and
                    the product. The final project exam should be on a level where it can be used as an attachment to
                    job applications or as a proposal for a real implementation.</p>
